This directory contains the data loggers for the gaming health project. The data loggers are used to collect health data from various sources, including EKG, keyboard...

Loggers are currently divided into 2 sibbranches:
1. Sensors: Remote sensors connected via raspberry pi.
2. PC: Stuff connected to PC (mouse, keyboard).

## Requirements
#### Sensors 
- Micropython
- EKG sensor (setup: https://github.com/ondrabimka/raspberry_pico_sensors/blob/main/raspberry_pico_sensors/ekg_heartbeat/README.md)

#### PC
- Python (PC)

## File Structure

The data loggers are organized in the following structure:
PC - 
SENSORS - 

## Data Files


## Next Steps
- Implement data collection from additional sources
- Enhance data logging capabilities
- Improve data processing and storage
- Develop real-time monitoring tools
