# Data Exploration
This directory contains the data exploration resources for the gaming health project. The data exploration process involves analyzing the recorded data to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can be used for further research and analysis.

## Next Steps
The next steps in the data exploration process include:
- Exploring additional data sources
- Conducting more in-depth analysis
- Creating interactive visualizations
- Building predictive models

## Hypotheses
The following hypotheses will be explored during the data exploration process:
1. The gaming session duration has a significant impact on the player's heart rate.
2. The type of game played influences the player's heart rate variability.
3. The player's physical condition (e.g., fatigue, stress) affects their gaming performance and heart rate.
4. The use of different gaming peripherals (e.g., keyboard, mouse, controller) has varying effects on the player's heart rate and gaming performance.
5. The time of day when gaming affects the player's heart rate and performance.
6. The player's emotional state during gaming sessions can be inferred from heart rate variability and gaming performance metrics.
7. The impact of gaming on the player's overall health and well-being can be assessed through a combination of heart rate data, gaming performance, and self-reported health metrics.
8. Health bar and other in-game indicators can be correlated with heart rate data to understand stress and excitement levels during gameplay.
