4. **Basic Usage**:
    ```python
    # EKG Analysis
    from gaming_health_data.src.EKGAnalyzer import EKGAnalyzer
    ekg_data = EKGAnalyzer.read_file("data.txt", sensor_type="PolarH10")
    summary = ekg_data.EKG.get_heart_analysis_summary()
    
    # Gaming Health Correlation
    from gaming_health_data.src.gaming_health_correlator import GamingHealthCorrelator

### Analysis Capabilities

#### 💓 **Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Analysis**
```
📊 Sample Output:
❤️  Mean HR: 85.6 bpm | 🔄 Avg RR: 701 ms | ⏱️  Duration: 53.5 min | 🎯 Beats: 4579
📈 HRV Metrics: RMSSD: 61.3 ms | SDNN: 96.1 ms | pNN50: 7.2% | HRV Score: 75/100  
🌊 Frequency: LF/HF ratio: 2.98 | 🫀 Rhythm: Sinus rhythm | ⚠️  Arrhythmia: No | 😰 Stress: 38/100
```

#### 🎮 **Gaming Event Detection**
- **Deaths**: Automatic detection when player health = 0
- **Major Damage**: Rapid health drops (>30 health in <2 seconds)  
- **Low Health Periods**: Extended time below 25% health
- **Healing Events**: Rapid health increases (healing/health packs)

#### 📊 **Correlation Analysis**  
- **Pre/Post Event Analysis**: Heart rate changes 10 seconds before/after events
- **Event Severity Impact**: Different physiological responses by event severity
- **Recovery Patterns**: How quickly heart rate returns to baseline
- **Session-Wide Patterns**: Overall stress trends during gaming
